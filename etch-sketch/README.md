# Etch-a-Sketch

I made an Etch-a-Sketch using JS,CSS3, and HTML5. The default grid is 16x16. Users can change the grid size from any number between 2 and 64. The user also has the option to change the default color of grey to rainbow by clicking the rainbow button. If the user presses the clear button then the grid is cleared of all color and returns to the original default grid grey color.
